# Machine Learning Playground
(**This was a final project for 10-401 Intro to Machine Learning**)

The ML Playground is an interactive envrionment to learn about different machine learning algorithims by playing with them.

## Algorithms to play with
* Simple feed-forward neural net with backpropogation
* K Nearest Neighbors

(note: the neural net doesn't work. I never had enough time to figure out if there was a bug in the implimentation, or if this specific classification problem and NN architecture were a bad match. Cest la vie)


## Instalation
* Clone this repo
* Install pygame with `pip install pygame`
* Install numpy with `pip install numpy`
* Navigate to the into the repo and run `python Main.py`
